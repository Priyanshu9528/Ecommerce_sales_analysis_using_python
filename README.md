# Superstore Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset to uncover insights related to sales, profit, and customer behavior.

## Project Link
You can access the project notebook on Google Colab: [Superstore Analysis Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z27es9X5PnEL5nioxg4n87jU6PVnbamz#scrollTo=kjGHSiKtq45j)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in `SuperStore.xlsx`. It contains sales records from a superstore, including information about orders, products, shipping, customer segments, and financials like sales, discounts, and profit.

### Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer placing the order.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product purchased.
- **Sales**: Total sales amount for the order.
- **Profit**: Profit earned from the order.
- **Order Date**: Date the order was placed.
- **Ship Date**: Date the order was shipped.

## Analysis

The notebook covers various stages of data analysis, including:

1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is read using Pandas from an Excel file.
2. **Initial Exploration**: The structure, shape, and basic statistics of the data are examined.
   - The dataset contains 1952 rows and 25 columns.
   - A quick check for missing values revealed that there are very few missing entries.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the data is consistent and clean by removing or handling missing or incorrect data.
4. **Visualization**: Several plots are generated to visualize key trends in the data, such as:
   - Sales by region.
   - Profit by customer segment.
   - Distribution of discounts and shipping modes.
   - Correlations between different numerical features.


## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To read, clean, and manipulate the dataset.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
